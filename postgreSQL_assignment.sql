-- 📂 Database Setup

-- 1. Create a new database named "bookstore_db" or any appropriate name.
CREATE DATABASE bookstore_db;

-- 2. Connect to the newly created database.
\c bookstore_db;

-- 1️⃣ Create a "books" table with the following fields:

-- id (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each book.
-- title: The name of the book.
-- author: The author of the book.
-- price: The price of the book (must be non-negative, enforced via CHECK constraint).
-- stock: The number of available copies in stock.
-- published_year: The year the book was published.

CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL CHECK (price >= 0),
    stock INT CHECK (stock >= 0),
    published_year INT
);

-- 2️⃣ Create a "customers" table with the following fields:

-- id (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each customer.
-- name: The full name of the customer.
-- email: The email address of the customer (must be unique).
-- joined_date: The date the customer registered (default to the current date).

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    joined_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);

-- 3️⃣ Create an "orders" table with the following fields:

-- id (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each order.
-- customer_id (Foreign Key): References the id field in the "customers" table.
-- book_id (Foreign Key): References the id field in the "books" table.
-- quantity: The number of books ordered (must be greater than zero).
-- order_date: The date and time when the order was placed (default to the current timestamp).

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(id) NOT NULL,
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT CHECK (quantity > 0),
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


-- 📂 PostgreSQL Problems
-- 1️⃣ Find books that are out of stock.
SELECT * FROM books WHERE stock = 0;
-- 2️⃣ Retrieve the most expensive book in the store.

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 1;

-- 3️⃣ Find the total number of orders placed by each customer.
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) AS total_orders
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name;


-- 4️⃣ Calculate the total revenue generated from book sales.
SELECT SUM(b.price * o.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM books b
JOIN orders o ON b.id = o.book_id;

-- 5️⃣ List all customers who have placed more than one order.
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) AS total_orders
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 1;
